While working part-time, my hours varied each week, I had to manually fill in my dates and hours and calculate my salary. Iâ€™d send my timesheet to HR, only to get a reply saying I miscalculated my pay or forgotten to add my cost code.

Recognizing the inefficiency, I decided to automate the entire process using Python. I developed a Python script that automatically calculates the total hours I worked, computes my salary based on predefined rates, and generates a neatly formatted report. The script then outputs this data in a format that is ready to send to HR, drastically reducing the time spent on this task and eliminating errors in calculation.

The automation not only streamlined my workflow but also ensured consistency and accuracy, freeing up valuable time that could be better spent on more productive activities.

Technologies used:

Python (for logic and calculations)
Microsoft Outlook API (to automate email submission)
DocxTemplate (for generating formatted reports)

This project has been an excellent opportunity for me to apply programming skills to solve a real-world problem, showcasing the power of automation in everyday tasks.
